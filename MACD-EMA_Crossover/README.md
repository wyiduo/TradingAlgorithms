#### Algorithm Summary
Given a universe with the top 500 stocks by market capitalization in the United States, the algorithm takes a long position in any stock in the universe when its MACD line cuts through its signal line from below. The algorithm will liquidate its long position in a stock it holds if that stock's MACD line cuts through its signal line from above.
